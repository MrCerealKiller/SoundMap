# Sound Map

## Description
Mobile application that uses audio sampling to perform acoustic mapping.

## Usage
After identifying themselves, the user opens a map (Google Maps API), and
can record an initial sample. Upon completion, a new target will be issued,
until a full map is built by the server.
